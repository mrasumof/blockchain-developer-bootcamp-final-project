<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

<h3>Title: Real-estate Crowdfunding Platform</h3>

The idea of this project is to create a platform where people can buy a share of a Real-estate investment, and participate proportionally in the profit of the project. 
Real estate investments usually require a big investment and therefore there are high barriers to entry for a regular person. I want to democratize the access to this profit
making business.

<h3>High-level Process</h3>

<ul>
  <li> An opportunity project in Real Estate is dsicovered, a budget and project plan is created and published in a portal. The opportunity also includes how much is the minimum investment in the opportunity</li>
  <li> This project generates an NFT with the property</li>
  <li> Also it generates a smart contract, and mint tokens</li>
  <li> Investors will be able to buy a percentage of the business by purchasing project tokens through the use of a portal and an e-wallet</li> 
</ul>
