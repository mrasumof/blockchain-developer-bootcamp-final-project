<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

<h3>Title: Real-estate Crowdfunding Platform</h3>

The idea of this project is to create a platform where people can buy a share of a Real-estate investment, and participate proportionally in the profit of the project. 
Real estate investments usually require a big investment and therefore there are high barriers to entry for a regular person. I want to democratize the access to this profit
making business.
